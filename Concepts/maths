// Binary Exponentiation

// Divisors


// for the even and odd,
// when you need to find the same number or say even number of occurences, use xor concept instead of storing frequency
// that will find the number of occurences as odd or even


// if the mod is given in the problem 
// then inverse may or may not exist if gcd of number and mod is not 1 then you have to find a different approach where inverse is not needed.
