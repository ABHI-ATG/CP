// mod
//  difference of consecutive elements of array d1 d2 d3 ,,,, dn;
// the gcd of(dx,,,dy) if greater than 1 it means number exist which can divide the array elements whose difference is (dx,,,,dy)
// 


// 
// we can represent even number by 2 prime number except 2
// an odd number can be represented by 1,2,3
// 1:if the number is already prime
// 2: if n-2 is prime then answer will be n-2 and 2
// 3: otherwise 3 prime numbers will involved


// 
// to find how many numbers will give 2 after divide into x (lets say x =10) 
// 10/2-(10/3);
//  5 - 3 = 2 (5,4)
// 


// median
// median is the middle element and it is the value, if we try to convert all elements to median element then total cost will be minimum;


// divisor
// a and b are two number
// to find all divisor of a*b
// multiply each divisor of x to each divisor of y
